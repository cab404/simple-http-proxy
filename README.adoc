Simple Http Proxy
=================

KISS HTTP-only proxy, written in Go.

Configuration is done in suckless-like way: Modify `config.go` and recompile.

====
_Example configuration_
```go
package main

const (
	// Two 10K allocations per connection. Pretty jumbo, it makes sense to set it lower
    // if you have a lot of small writes.
	BUFFER_PIPE = 10 * 1024

	// Limit on URL length.
	BUFFER_STATUS_LINE = 1024
)

func Config() ServerContext {
	return ServerContext{
		Routes: []Route{
			{"cups", "cups-srv:631"},
			{"megaprx", "proxytwo:8080"},
			{"xample", "example.com:80"},
		},
		ListenAddress: ":8883",
	}
}

```
====

Since this proxy doesn't modify anything inside a connection, apart from stripping first path segment, it won't usually work with regular HTTP clients without specifying Host header manually.

====
    curl 0:8883/xample/ -H 'Host: example.com'
